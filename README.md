# **Abraham Calculator GUI**

**⚠️ Unstable ⚠️**

Project is a work in progress and is **NOT** finished, although very close to completion.

# **Issues**

As far as I'm aware the current code has no "errors" but it isn't finished yet. I've ran several calculations through this calculator and every value for positon/velocity has been correct. **Roudning issues** may occur due to this program having an extra digit, I believe this is because how floats differ in Rust and Java, although I haven't ran into any myself.

# **Misc**

This project will be finsihed soon however not much is left to do

- ~~All I/O fields~~
- ~~Rust calculations~~ _\*_
- ~~Limits & boundaries~~
- Output results inside GUI

_\* ( Only Y velocities and positions are calculated for now, faster speeds when debugging)_
